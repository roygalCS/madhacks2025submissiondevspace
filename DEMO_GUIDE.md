- "All features work: video calls, voice, GitHub, tasks"
- "Ready for Y Combinator demo"

## 💡 Key Talking Points

### What Makes This Special:
1. **Real-time 3D Avatars** - Not just chatbots, actual visual presence
2. **Parallel Work** - 4 engineers work simultaneously
3. **GitHub Integration** - They actually code and push changes
4. **Voice-First** - Natural conversation, not just typing
5. **Production Ready** - Full MVP, not a prototype

### Technical Highlights:
- Ready Player Me 3D avatars with lip sync
- Real-time STT/TTS with FishAudio
- Multi-agent coordination
- GitHub API integration
- Supabase backend
