# DevSpace vs FaceTimeOS: Comparison & Advantages

## Overview

Both projects enable AI voice agents, but serve different purposes and audiences. Here's how DevSpace compares to [FaceTimeOS](https://github.com/ThePickleGawd/FaceTimeOS) and what makes it better for software engineering collaboration.

## Key Differences

### 1. **Platform & Accessibility**

| Feature | FaceTimeOS | DevSpace |

### 6. **User Experience**

| Feature | FaceTimeOS | DevSpace |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Onboarding** | Complex (permissions, BlackHole setup) | Simple (just connect GitHub) |
| **Interface** | FaceTime/iMessage (native) | Custom web UI (purpose-built) |
| **Task Management** | ❌ No built-in | ✅ Full task system |
| **Engineer Profiles** | ❌ Single agent | ✅ Multiple engineers, specialties |
| **Chat History** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Persistent, searchable |
| **Code Context** | ❌ No | ✅ Full repository awareness |

**DevSpace Advantage:** ✅ **Better UX for Developers** - Purpose-built interface for engineering workflows, not repurposed messaging apps.

---

### 7. **Real-Time Capabilities**

| Feature | FaceTimeOS | DevSpace |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Video Latency** | Low (native FaceTime) | Low (WebRTC optimized) |
| **STT Latency** | Real-time (FishAudio) | Real-time (chunked FishAudio) |
| **TTS Latency** | Real-time (FishAudio) | Instant (Web Speech API) |
| **Response Time** | Depends on Agent-S | Optimized for code tasks |

**DevSpace Advantage:** ✅ **Optimized for Code** - Faster responses for code-related queries, instant TTS with Web Speech API.

- ❌ Mac computer
- ❌ Complex setup (BlackHole, permissions)
- ❌ Terminal/command line knowledge

DevSpace requires:
- ✅ Any device with a browser
- ✅ Just visit the URL
- ✅ No installation needed

### 👥 **3. Team Collaboration Features**

FaceTimeOS:
